# SW5E BOT

# _The first and only Star Wars 5th Edition TTRPG bot._

SW5E bot is a discord bot used to power online SW5E (Star Wars 5th Edition) games.
SW5E bot is still young and in development, and is intended to include loads of additional features.


This is in no way affiliated to the official Disney Star Wars, Wizards of the Coast Dungeons and Dragons nor the SW5E website.
I am a fully independent developper using this project as an excuse to learn new technologies and implementing everything I want on my way.

Current supported commands:
- /help - displays a nice little help page
- /roll [a]d[b]+[c] - performs a dice roll. For example, /roll 2d4+2 returns any value between 4 and 10
